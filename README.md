## About this project:
This was my second app built using React Native and JavaScript with the help of Expo. It served as a foundational project in my journey of React Native mobile app development, incorporating concepts such as multiple components, modal screens, and React hooks and functions.
    

    
## HOW TO RUN THIS APP:-

## Just run the app!!!
If you can't run the app because of some dependencies or the emulator taking too much time, you can watch this YouTube video to get an idea of the project and its features
