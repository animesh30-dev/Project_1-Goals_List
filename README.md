## About this project:
This was my second app built using React Native and JavaScript with the help of Expo. It served as a foundational project in my journey of React Native mobile app development, incorporating concepts such as multiple components, modal screens, and React hooks and functions.
    

    
## HOW TO RUN THIS APP:-

  USE npm install expo@latest
  npm start
