## This was my first second app which was built using React Native and Javascript with the help of EXPO, and now I would be diving deeper into the world of development. The link to the project demonstration video is given below.
This app uses the concepts of multiple components,modal screens,and also about react hooks and functions. This was a pretty basic app and was a building block in my journey of react native mobile app development.
